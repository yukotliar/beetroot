# Product Store
#
# Write a class Product that has three attributes:
#     type
#     name
#     price
# Then create a class ProductStore, which will have some Products and will operate with all products in the store.
# All methods, in case they can’t perform its action, should raise ValueError with appropriate error information.
#
# Tips: Use aggregation/composition concepts while implementing the ProductStore class.
# You can also implement additional classes to operate on a certain type of product, etc.
#
# Also, the ProductStore class must have the following methods:
#     add(product, amount) - adds a specified quantity of a single product with a predefined price premium
#     for your store (30 percent)
#     set_discount(identifier, percent, identifier_type=’name’) - adds a discount for all products specified by input
#     identifiers (type or name).The discount must be specified in percentage
#     sell_product(product_name, amount) - removes a particular amount of products from the store
#     if available, in other case raises an error.It also increments income if the sell_product method succeeds
#     get_income() - returns amount of many earned by ProductStore instance
#     get_all_products() - returns information about all available products in the store
#     get_product_info(product_name) - returns a tuple with product name and amount of items in the store
