# Library
#
# Write a class structure that implements a library. Classes:
#
# 1) Library - name, books = [], authors = []
#
# 2) Book - name, year, author (author must be an instance of Author class)
#
# 3) Author - name, country, birthday, books = []
#
# Library class
#
# Methods:
#
# - new_book(name: str, year: int, author: Author) - returns an instance of Book class and adds the book to the books
# list for the current library.
#
# - group_by_author(author: Author) - returns a list of all books grouped by the specified author
#
# - group_by_year(year: int) - returns a list of all the books grouped by the specified year
#
# All 3 classes must have a readable __repr__ and __str__ methods.
#
# Also, the book class should have a class variable which holds the amount of all existing books
