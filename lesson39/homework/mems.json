It features an ATmega48, and 3 separate single axis MEMS gyros with analog signal conditioning. The analog gain is adjusted using those 3 pots.\n\nThat said, I guess you could make the argument this almost entirely analog, since the sensors output analog and opamp circuits are used to adjust the gain fed back to the controller.\n\nFrom what I gather, the idea was you make your own flight controller code to process the sensor data and adjust the output to servo connectors accordingly.",

            "body": "I understand this to a degree. My wife and I both work at home. I have been a (basically) full time WFH person for years, even before the pandemic. My wife had a pandemic-induced career change where she now works from home full time too. It was an adjustment and being here, cooped up in the house, with nowhere to go for the better part of two years changed things a lot. I felt like we became slaves to work and to the kids and we were 'ships passing in the night\". We would finish our respective workdays, make a meal, get the kids to bed, sit in bed and look at mems on our phone while whatever was on TV played out. Wash, rinse, repeat. I felt like we would ask each other how their day went without really listening cause either my job sound boring to her or her job sounded stressful to me. Talking to each other for the sake of talking to each other, hanging out, etc. felt weird. Like a mechanical formality.\n\nIn the same breath, we love each other very much, we were still making time for sex. we are supportive of each other's needs. If there is something I know she needs it's a done deal, but for a long spell, it was like I was living with a roomie that I got to bone, and two kids were present we needed to take care of collectively. And it felt weird, and bad, and sad.\n\nDuring the day I didn't want to bother her, and I am sure she didn't want to bother me. I dont know if it was just the pattern we fell into or what, but it felt similar to what you described, OP, above.  \n\n\nA number of people I know, through the pandemic split up, either broke up or got divorced, which I always found interesting. Thinking about that, at one point, made me reflect on our relationship, and that weird feeling, and I just felt like there needed to be a shift. So I asked my wife, in between her sessions if she wanted to have a lunch date. I made an effort to try and get off the phone when I saw her out of her office to engage in conversation. It took effort, and some anxiety that I was bugging her, but I wanted us to connect again more like the friends we were, because I just love her so much! Things slowly improved, as much as they can when you don't go anywhere or do anything, but we're trying to keep things light and fun. It takes work. But, its work and effort worth spending for me, because there is no one else I would rather be with!",

            "body": "Full text for those who can't see (summary - article is ass)\n\n\\-----------\n\nToday we are looking at MicroVision, Inc. (NASDAQ: MVIS), to determine if the MVIS stock is a good buy. We will look at MVIS financial ratios, analyst ratings, and valuation to determine a MVIS stock forecast and price.\n\n  \n***What Business is MVIS Stock Engaged In?***  \nMicroVision, Inc. develops lidar sensors used in automotive safety and autonomous driving applications. Its laser beam scanning technology is based on micro-electrical mechanical systems, laser diodes, opto-mechanics, electronics, algorithms, and software. The company also develops micro-display concepts and designs for head-mounted augmented reality (AR) headsets, as well as 1440i MEMS module that can support AR headsets; and Interactive Display modules used in smart speakers and other devices.  \n**MVIS Stock Forecast and Analysis**  \n***MicroVision, Inc. Competition and Comparables***  \nIn order to undergo a comparable analysis (to determine MVIS stocks value), we need to first outline who MVIS's competitors are. These competitors need to be publicly listed, have valid financial metrics/multiples, operate in a similar manner to MVIS, and have a market cap similar to MVIS (if possible).  \nBy keeping this in mind, I found the following list of companies to be some of MVIS stocks closest competitors:  \nUCTT, HIMX, VLDR, PUBM, XPER, and more  \n**MVIS Stock News and Information**\n\n  \n***Horrible Recent MVIS Earnings***  \nMVIS Earnings (Yearly):  \n\n\nMVIS Revenues: In FY 2021, MVIS experienced a yearly decrease in revenues of $-590k (or -19.09%) resulting in a total revenue figure of $2.5M.\n\n  \nMVIS Cost of Revenues: In FY 2021, MVIS experienced a yearly decrease in their cost of revenues of $-1.4M (-99.86%), resulting in a total revenue figure of $2000. Since the decrease (of -99.86%), in MVIS's cost of revenue was lesser (by -80.76%) than the decrease (of -19.09%) in MVIS's revenues, we should expect that MVIS experienced an increase in their FY gross profits.\n\n  \nMVIS Gross Profit: In FY 2021, MVIS experienced a yearly increase in their gross profit of $806k (or 47.64%) resulting in a total gross profit of $2.5M. This decrease is consistent with our conclusion from the comparison of revenues and cost of revenues between FY 2021 and FY 2020.\n\n  \nMVIS EBITDA: In FY 2021, MVIS experienced a yearly decrease in their EBITDA of $29,065,000 resulting in a total EBITDA of $-41.74M.\n\n  \nMVIS Net Income: In FY 2021, MVIS experienced a yearly decrease in their net income of $29,566,000 resulting in a total net income of $-43.2M.\n\n  \nMVIS EPS: As a result of MVIS's decrease in net income of $29.6M, MVIS's EPS also decreased (by $0.17) from $-0.1 in FY 2020 to $-0.27 in FY 2021\n\n  \nOverall, MVIS did not perform well financially in 2021 as most of their important metrics (EPS, Net Income, and EBITDA) all shrank by sizable amounts. However, MVIS is a high-growth stock, so maybe their more recent financials will show more growth and a more promising future for MVIS.  \n***MVIS Earnings (Quarterly):***\n\n  \nMVIS Revenues: In Q1 2022, MVIS experienced a quarterly decrease in revenues of $-207k (or -37.16%) resulting in a total revenue figure of $350k.\n\n  \nMVIS Cost of Revenues: In Q1 2022, MVIS experienced a quarterly decrease in their cost of revenues of $-44,000 (-91.67%), resulting in a total revenue figure of $4,000.\n\n  \nMVIS Gross Profit: In Q1 2022, MVIS experienced a quarterly decrease in their gross profit of $-163k (or -32.02%) resulting in a total gross profit of $346k. .\n\n  \nMVIS EBITDA: In Q1 2022, MVIS experienced a quarterly decrease in their EBITDA of $484,000 resulting in a total EBITDA of $-12.69M. This decrease (of 3.97%) stems from the fact that MVIS experienced a decrease in their gross profits of -32.02% (as we saw in the previous bullet point).\n\n  \nMVIS Net Income: In Q1 2022, MVIS experienced a quarterly decrease in their net income of $543,000 (or -4.3%) resulting in a total net income of $-13.17M.\n\n  \nMVIS EPS: Despite MVIS's decrease in net income of $543,000, MVIS's was able to keep their EPS constant from $-0.08 in Q4 2021 to $-0.08 in Q1 2022\n\n  \nOverall, it seems as though MVIS had a poor financial performance as many of their financial metrics shrunk or maintained, most notably their EPS , as well as their net income (by $543,000), and other metrics (as you can tell from the above bullet points).  \nAdditionally, MVIS stock missed their EPS estimate by -$0.01 (or -14.29%), as they reported an EPS of $-0.08 for the quarter (compared to their estimated EPS of $-0.07).  \n***No Possible MVIS Share Dilution***\n\n  \nAs part of their Q1 2022 earnings release, MVIS stated that they currently have 164.22M Shares Outstanding (weighted average), which is up 0 shares (from 164.22M shares outstanding in Q4 2021). Furthermore, MVIS stock has up to 0 of shares that they can issue (thereby diluting MVIS's stock). This is fantastic news for MVIS investors, as stock dilution does not seem to be an issue/worry here.  \n***What Ratings have Analysts Given the MVIS Stock?***  \nHere is the current spread of MVIS stock ratings. In total there are 4 MVIS stock ratings, which fall in the following categories.  \n3 Buys  \n1 Holds  \n0 Sells\n\n  \nAnalyst Ratings have provided relatively strong indicators of future price movement, which is why they are used to determine if MVIS stock is a buy or sell. Overall, there are not many analyst ratings out for MVIS yet, however the majority of current ratings are in favor of \"buying\" MVIS at it's current price.  \n**MVIS Stock Forecast and Valuation**  \n***MVIS Stock Forecast Using Comparable Analysis***  \nPrice to Book (P/B): MVIS's current P/B ratio is 6.32, compared to the average P/B ratio of MVIS's peers being 2.84. This implies that MVIS is overvalued and their share price should change by a factor of -54.99% to be at fair value (based on MVIS's P/B compared to the P/B of their peers).\n\n  \nPrice to Equity (P/E): MVIS stock P/E ratio is currently -13.04, compared to the average P/E ratio of MVIS's peers being -5.53. This implies that MVIS is overvalued and their share price should change by a factor of -57.62% to be at fair value (based on MVIS's P/E compared to the P/E of their peers).\n\n  \nOverall, MVIS stock is overvalued and needs to experience a change in stock price of (an average of) -56.3% to be considered \u201cat fair value\u201d. However, this may not be quite as bad as it may seem as the financial ratios of MVIS (and their competitors) are highly variable, which makes comparable analyses less relevant. Despite this I still think there is some merit to this prediction based on the fact that MVIS may be overvalued. The question that then remains is \"by how much?\".  \n***Is MVIS a good stock to buy right now?***  \nThere seems to be an equal amount of positives and negatives when looking at the MVIS stock  \nFirstly, when looking at the positives, MVIS has no shares that they have diluted over the past quarter, and they have no available shares to issue, thereby diluting the MVIS stock. Furthermore, the majority of analysts are ranking the MVIS stock as a \"buy\".  \nNext, when we look at the negatives of the MVIS stock, we notice a lack of good earnings that have been coming from MVIS over the past couple of years. Furthermore, we also know that their financial ratios indicate that they are overvalued.  \nOverall, it seems as though the negative aspects of MVIS outweigh the positive aspects in this case, which has lead me to take a bearish stance on the MVIS stock.I think that we could see a correction of maybe 10% (rather than the 50%+ achieved via the comparable analysis.",

            "body": "Looking through the degree as well as what RIT offers, they're *very* different, and I think this article and Purdue's linked article do a terrible job explaining it.\n\nThe RIT program is a job training program for the semiconductor manufacturing industry. It covers fabrication, chemistry, business stats, that sort of thing. The Purdue program is basically an MS in IC design and the undergrad EE/ECE classes that are pre-reqs for it. One will prepare you to help run or work in a fab, the other will help you be a designer at Qualcomm.\n\n30-40 years ago, you could become an IC designer with just a BS, but now you get thrown in the trash without at least an MS. That's because IC design requires T-shaped skills, while an EE undergrad degree is more...Gaussian. So you have to then do an MS to get experience in fabrication and mixed-signal IC design, maybe do some research and get a tapeout. The Purdue program tries to go straight for CMOS analog and MEMS fabrication and shit by your fourth year in undergrad. On the other hand the RIT major has you taking basic Linear Systems in your fourth year, but has more IC fab and tech courses earlier on.\n\nPurdue: https://engineering.purdue.edu/semiconductors/degrees\n\nRIT: https://www.rit.edu/study/microelectronic-engineering-bs",

Any legitimate company can spend the money and create an asic chip.   \n\nMy understanding is what makes mvis tech so special is that we can move our mems do something so special that no one else can do that in order to get the dynamic range and high resolution at 30 fps.  Edge computing seems to help with speed but not necessarily the actual special functions of mvis mems.",
